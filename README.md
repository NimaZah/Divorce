# Divorce
**Nima Zahedinameghi**

Divorce Predictors Scale (DPS) is a scale that measures the probability of divorce. Here, I try to use ML to predict the probability of divorce for couples based on the loaded dataset. The results of my model to predict divorce probability are shown in the end of the analysis. My model has the accuracy of 98%.
